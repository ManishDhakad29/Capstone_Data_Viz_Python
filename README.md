# Capstone_Data_Viz_Python# Capstone Project: Social Media Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 Vaccine

## 📊 Project Overview
This project retrieves, processes, and visualizes real-world data from social media (Twitter) to analyze public sentiment regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. The entire data pipeline is built using Python, SQLite, and the Plotly visualization library.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Data Retrieval:** Tweepy (Twitter API)
- **Data Processing/Analysis:** Pandas, NLTK (for Sentiment Scoring)
- **Database:** SQLite3
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Flask (for web dashboard)

## 🚀 Key Findings
- [Specific finding 1: e.g., 60% of tweets were positive about the vaccine.]
- [Specific finding 2: e.g., Negative sentiment peaked in March 2021.]
